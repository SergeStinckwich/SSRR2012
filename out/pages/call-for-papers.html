<p>The 10th anniversary of the IEEE International Symposium on Safety, Security, and Rescue Robotics with continue its tradition of attracting cutting-edge papers in the theory and practice of robots for rapid and secure inspection of critical infrastructure, travelers,luggage, and paces; disaster response and recovery; humanitarian demining, disaster mitigation and recovery; detection of chemical, biological and radiological risks and operations in these dangerous sites; etc</p>

<p>SSRR 2012 will also serve as an entry point for researchers and technologists who want to learn more about SSR robotics, through tutorials and keynotes including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Dr. Gill Pratt, DARPA Grand Robotics Challenge</li>
<li>Dr. Richard Voyles, NSF National Robotics Initiative</li>
<li>Prof. Hajime Asama, University of Tokyo, Nuclear Decommissioning</li>

<p>Papers and participation fall into: </p>

<ul>
<li>regular papers (4-6 pages) that describe original work in SSR or work that can be applied to SSR domains</li>
<li>center/project papers (2-4 pages) that describe work at centers or active multi-institutional projects </li>
